# Handler Behaviors [Behavior:Handler:1.0]

## Core Behaviors

### LLM Interaction

1. **Provider Abstraction**
   - Handler abstracts provider-specific details
   - Each provider requires a specific adapter
   - Common payload structure transformed as needed

2. **Conversation Management**
   - One Handler per task execution
   - Complete conversation history maintained
   - Messages tracked with roles and timestamps
   - Clear session lifecycle (init → execute → cleanup)

### Resource Management

1. **Turn Counting**
   - Turns incremented for all LLM responses
   - User messages do not increment turn count
   - Tool responses do not increment turn count
   - Turn limits enforced at Handler level

2. **Context Window Management**
   - Token counting uses heuristic estimation
   - Context includes all conversation history and inputs
   - Warnings generated at 80% of limit
   - Hard limit enforced with appropriate errors

3. **Resource Reporting**
   - Current metrics accessible via getResourceMetrics()
   - Metrics included in error responses
   - Clean termination on resource exhaustion

### Tool Execution

1. **Direct Tools**
   - Executed synchronously by Handler
   - Results returned directly to LLM
   - No continuation mechanism

2. **Subtask Tools**
   - Return CONTINUATION status
   - Include subtask_request in notes
   - Structured according to [Pattern:SubtaskSpawning:1.0]

3. **User Input Tools**
   - Standard tool for requesting user input
   - Uses callback pattern for integration
   - Results added to conversation history

### Error Handling

1. **Resource Exhaustion**
   - Clean termination with metrics
   - Clear error structure with resource type
   - No automatic retry attempts

2. **Tool Execution Errors**
   - Wrapped in standard error structure
   - Propagated to caller
   - Include context when available
