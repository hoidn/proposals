# Error Type Hierarchy and Handling Design

## Purpose
Define the core error taxonomy and handling strategy for the intelligent task execution system. Errors serve as a control flow mechanism to enable dynamic task adaptation and recovery.

## Error Categories

### 1. Resource Exhaustion
- **Purpose**: Signal when system resource limits are exceeded
- **Characteristics**:
  - Parameterized resource type (turns, context, or output)
  - Structured metrics tracking usage and limits
  - Clear error messages for debugging
  - No execution state preservation
- **Recovery Strategy**: 
  - Trigger task decomposition into smaller units
  - Resource metrics inform decomposition strategy

### 2. Invalid Output Structure
- **Purpose**: Signal task output validation failures
- **Characteristics**:
  - Independent of operator type
  - Captures specific validation violations
  - Focused on structural correctness
  - No semantic validation required
- **Recovery Strategy**:
  - Trigger alternative task formulation
  - Use violation details to guide reformulation

### 3. XML Parse Errors
- **Purpose**: Signal fundamental XML syntax failures
- **Characteristics**:
  - Immediate failure on malformed XML
  - Includes error location information
  - Basic syntax-level issues only
- **Recovery Strategy**:
  - Evaluator handles recovery
  - No internal retry attempts

### 4. Validation Errors
- **Purpose**: Signal higher-level structural or template validation failures
- **Characteristics**:
  - Schema conformance issues
  - Missing required fields
  - Invalid field values
  - Includes path to validation failure
- **Recovery Strategy**:
  - Evaluator handles recovery
  - May trigger template adjustments

## Error Handling Principles

### 1. Separation of Concerns
- Errors focus on specific failure conditions with relevant structured data
- Progress tracking belongs to task system
- Retry counting belongs to evaluator
- Context management handled by memory system

### 2. Control Flow
- Each error type maps to specific recovery path:
  - Resource Exhaustion → Task Decomposition (guided by metrics)
  - Invalid Output → Alternative Formulation (guided by violations)
  - XML Parse Error → Immediate failure handling
  - Validation Error → Template/structure adjustment
- Recovery limit enforced by evaluator

### 3. Structured Error Data
- Errors include type-specific structured data:
  - Resource metrics for exhaustion
  - Violation details for invalid output
  - Location data for parse errors
  - Path information for validation errors
- No execution state or retry history
- Data focused on guiding recovery strategy

## Integration Points

### Task System
- Raises appropriate error types
- Includes outputs in standard format
- Handles structured error generation

### Evaluator
- Tracks retry attempts
- Maps errors to recovery strategies
- Uses error data to guide recovery

### Memory System
- Maintains execution context
- Handles context retrieval/updates
- Provides context for error details when needed

## Design Decisions & Rationale

1. Limited Error Categories
   - Rationale: Maps to core failure modes
   - Benefit: Direct mapping to recovery paths
   - Impact: Predictable error handling

2. Stateless Error Design
   - Rationale: Separates failure signaling from recovery
   - Benefit: Clean separation of concerns
   - Impact: Simplified error handling

3. Fixed Recovery Paths
   - Rationale: Each error type has clear recovery strategy
   - Benefit: Predictable system behavior
   - Impact: Streamlined implementation

## Dependencies
- Task system must implement standard output format
- Evaluator must track retries
- Memory system must support context updates

## Open Questions & Risks

1. Recovery Strategy Boundaries
   - Clear separation between strategies
   - Strategy selection criteria
   - Strategy effectiveness measurement

2. Context Selection
   - Context relevance during recovery
   - Context update boundaries
   - Context consistency requirements

## Future Considerations

1. Error Response Refinement
   - Strategy effectiveness tracking
   - Context selection optimization
   - Recovery path optimization

2. System Monitoring
   - Error pattern analysis
   - Resource utilization tracking
   - Recovery success rates
