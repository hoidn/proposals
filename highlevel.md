- Distinct from atomic operations (which execute as single units)

# Project Overview: Intelligent Task Execution System

## 1. Problem Statement
Software development and technical tasks require breaking down complex requirements into executable units. This typically requires human expertise for:
- Decomposing large tasks into smaller, manageable pieces
- Recovering from failures by trying alternative approaches
- Maintaining relevant context across related subtasks
- Combining partial results into complete solutions

This project aims to automate this process through a system that can understand, decompose, and execute complex tasks while handling failures gracefully and maintaining task coherence.
