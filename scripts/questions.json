    "1. What are the specific return status values beyond 'continuation'?",
    "2. How should existing tasks that rely on partial output be migrated?",
    "3. Should continuation status include metadata about the intended subtask?",
    "4. How does the return status system interact with resource exhaustion errors?",
    "5. What is the scope of \"subtask spawning\" - is it limited to predefined task types or more flexible?",
    "6. How should sequential tasks handle continuation status from their steps?",
    "7. Should reduce tasks support continuation status in their inner_task or reduction_task?"
