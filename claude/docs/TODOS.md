# System TODOs and Status

# Critical Path TODOs - Corrected Status

## Interface Consolidation ‚ö†Ô∏è BLOCKING

### Completed (‚úì)
1. Memory System interface version defined [Interface:Memory:2.0]
2. File content type handling standardized (Handler tools)
3. Unified storage approach defined in ADR
   - Memory System: metadata and context
   - Handler tools: file access
   - Clear separation of concerns

### Still Needed (‚ùå)
1. Update Task System Implementation
   - Update components/task-system/spec/interfaces.md to use [Interface:Memory:2.0]
   - Remove old memory structure definitions
   - Update any dependent interfaces

2. Version Number Alignment
   - Verify all cross-references use correct versions
   - Update any outdated references to [Interface:Memory:2.0]
   - Ensure consistent version numbering across documentation

## Resource and File Management ‚ö†Ô∏è BLOCKING

### Completed (‚úì)
1. File tracking ownership decided
   - Memory System owns metadata index
   - Handler tools own file access
   - Clear delegation pattern defined

2. Resource tracking responsibilities documented
   - Handler owns resource limits
   - Memory System handles metadata only
   - Clear separation established

3. File access patterns defined
   - Handler tools for file operations
   - Memory System for metadata
   - Clean separation documented

### Still Needed (‚ùå)
1. Interface Updates
   - Update Task System interfaces to reflect current patterns
   - Remove deprecated memory structures
   - Add missing Handler tool interfaces if needed
   - Ensure consistent patterns across all interface documentation

## Next Steps
1. Focus on updating Task System interfaces
2. Complete version number verification
3. Update any remaining documentation to reflect current architecture

## Notes
- Most architectural decisions are complete and documented
- Main work needed is implementation alignment
- Focus should be on updating Task System to match current architecture

## Feature Implementation
