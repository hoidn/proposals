# TODOS and Implementation Plan

This document categorizes all remaining tasks and provides a prioritized implementation plan. The goals are to ensure system consistency, complete documentation, and implement remaining features in a logical order.

## Status Categories

Tasks are organized into four categories:

1. **Complete**: Implemented and documented in the system architecture
2. **Incomplete**: Well-defined goals that need implementation
3. **Inconsistent**: Items that conflict with other components or decisions
4. **Unclear**: Items requiring clarification before implementation

## Complete ✓

### Interface and Memory System
- Memory System interface version defined [Interface:Memory:3.0]
- File content type handling standardized (Handler tools)
- Unified storage approach defined in ADR
- Memory Component Separation with clear interfaces and integration documentation
- File tracking ownership decided (Memory System owns metadata, Handler owns file operations)
- Resource tracking responsibilities documented in Pattern:ResourceManagement:1.0
- File operation responsibility boundaries clearly defined:
  * Memory System: Manages ONLY metadata (file paths and descriptive strings)
  * Handler: Performs ALL file I/O operations using appropriate tools (including Anthropic's computer use tools for Anthropic models)
  * Clear separation of concerns between metadata management and file operations
- Memory System version consistently referenced as 3.0 across all documentation
- updateContext method references removed; documentation consistently reflects read-only context model
- Tool calls vs. subtasks boundaries clearly defined:
  * Tool calls: Handler-managed deterministic operations with rigid APIs
  * Subtasks: LLM-to-LLM interactions using continuation mechanism
  * Clear component responsibilities established for each type

### Context Management
- Document best practices (ADR 004, ADR 14)
- Define efficient subtask patterns (sequential)
- Extend `inherit_context` to map/reduce operators (ADR 14)
- Provide partial-result guidance via accumulation_format (ADR 9, ADR 14)
- Consolidate environment usage across context types
- Add context reuse mechanisms via context_management block
- Update error taxonomy for context failures (ADR 8)

### Task Type System & Patterns
- Basic task types defined and implemented
- Subtask support via standardized mechanism (ADR 11)
- Map operator implementation
- Director-Evaluator pattern with script execution integration
- Function-based templates with parameter declaration (ADR 12)
- Task continuation protocol via CONTINUATION status
- JSON-based output standardization (ADR 13)
- Partial results policy implemented (ADR 9)

12. **Write user stories and examples**
    - Create comprehensive user stories showing system usage

    - Integrate with existing components

17. **Multi-LLM support**

## Inconsistent ⚠️

~~2. **Task-subtask context inheritance**~~
   ~~- Multiple conflicting descriptions exist~~
   ~~- Standardize on the approach defined in ADR 14~~
   
   *Completed: Implemented atomic task subtypes with different context management defaults. Standard atomic tasks inherit context but don't generate fresh context, while subtasks don't inherit context but do generate fresh context.*

## Unclear ❓

1. **"Genetic" behavior implementation**
   - Clarify how multiple tries and result selection would work
   - Define evaluation criteria for selecting best solutions

2. **Subtask spawning and evaluator interaction**
   - Detail exactly how subtasks spawned by task system work with evaluator
   - Specify control flow and context handling

3. **Architecture documentation "self-similarity"**
   - Define what "self-similarity in structure" means for documentation
   - Provide concrete examples of desired documentation patterns

4. **Agent-style workflow patterns**
   - Clarify implementation of "conversation → json → map spec prompts" pattern
   - Provide examples of intended workflow

5. **Chat queue implementation**
   - Specify requirements for chat queue management
   - Define integration with task system

6. **Shell node integration**
   - Clarify how "shell" nodes fit into the architecture
   - Define interaction with Director-Evaluator pattern

7. **Model temperature/selection handling**
   - Determine whether model parameters should be handled at system level
   - Define configuration approach

8. **Multi-try evaluation criteria**
   - Specify how to implement evaluation criteria for selecting best results
   - Define scoring mechanisms and decision process

## Dependencies and Critical Path

The critical path for completing the system involves:

1. Documentation and interface consistency (Phase 1)
2. Core implementation improvements (Phase 2)
3. Architecture documentation and use cases (Phase 3)
4. Advanced features (Phase 4)

Items within Phase 1 should be completed first as they provide the foundation for all subsequent work. Within each phase, items are listed in priority order based on dependencies and impact.


user story:
make plan docs interactively (or with a prompt queue), write them to file; add them to heritable context; gen spec prompts; subtask -> try to impl spec prompt, up to 3 round of debugging; on failure return to parent task 
CONTINUATION with failure notes; parent tries to debug (either itself or with full context subtask) or maybe something else. 
bonus: failure notes get interpreted as lessons and are used to update plan or project_rules.md

- does handler need a 'dumb' llm backend to prompt the main agent to continue?
- how will git integration work?
- get rid of natural language -> xml path, just use natural language -> dsl. this avoids nested xml ugliness, clarifies the use of xml as formatting for a single prompt
- option to pass list of file paths to subtask

## Resolved Questions

- ✓ RESOLVED: Template substitution is an Evaluator responsibility. The Evaluator resolves all {{variable_name}} placeholders before dispatching tasks to the Handler.
