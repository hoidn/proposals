# Implementation Design

## Terminology and References

 - **Handler** and **Evaluator** definitions are standardized in [spec/types.md](../spec/types.md).
 - XML schema definitions are available in [system/contracts/protocols.md](../system/contracts/protocols.md).
 - For detailed resource tracking implementation (including turn counter and context window monitoring), see [resource-management.md](./resource-management.md).
 - For XML processing details (parsing, validation, and fallback behavior), refer to [xml-processing.md](./xml-processing.md).

## Handler Implementation
### Session Management Strategy
- One Handler per task execution
- Create new Handler instance per executeTask call
- Configure with immutable resource limits
- Set system prompt during initialization
- Clean session termination on completion
  
### Resource Tracking Implementation
- Turn counter per Handler
- Context window size monitoring
- Token usage tracking
- Resource limit enforcement
- No cross-Handler resource sharing

### Error Propagation Design
- Standard error type system
- Immediate propagation on detection
- Clean resource release
- No retry attempt handling
- Complete error context preservation

### Interactive Session Support
- Input detection capabilities
- Agent-controlled input requests
- Resource tracking during interaction
- Input timeout handling
- Cancellation support

## Template Management
### Storage Implementation
- XML file-based storage
- Disk-based persistence
- Directory organization by type
- Template versioning support
- Schema validation enforcement
  
### Validation Implementation
- Basic XML structure validation
- Schema conformance checking
- Warning generation for issues
- Template field validation
- Model availability checking
  
### Matching Algorithm Design
- Scoring based on prompt results
- Top-N candidate selection
- Separate matching for human input vs AST
- Score normalization
- Clear ordering requirements
  
### XML Processing Details
- Lenient parsing with fallback
- Warning collection
- Graceful degradation
- Partial parsing support
- Clear error locations

## Resource Management
### Turn Counter Implementation
- Per-Handler tracking
- Limit enforcement
- No cross-Handler pooling
- Clear counting rules
- Turn usage metrics
  
### Context Window Management
- Token counting approach
- Size limit enforcement
- No optimization strategy
- Window usage monitoring
- Clear limit boundaries
  
### Limit Enforcement Strategy
- Immediate termination on violation
- Resource exhaustion error generation
- Clean session cleanup
- Resource usage reporting
- Clear violation metrics
  
### Error Detection Mechanisms
- Resource limit monitoring, progress tracking, output and XML structure validation, and input validation.

### Script Execution Implementation
The system now supports executing external scripts as part of a static director-evaluator workflow. When a task of type "script" is encountered, the Handler:
- Detects the "script" task type.
- Executes the specified external command (e.g. a bash script).
- Captures the command's standard output, error output, and exit code.
- Passes the script's output to the subsequent evaluator task.

This design ensures that the director's output flows seamlessly through the script execution step before final evaluation.

## Integration Points
### Memory System Interaction
- Uses Anthropic's computer use tools for file operations.
- Read-only access.
- No state maintenance.
- Clear context boundaries.
- Standard memory structure.
  
### Compiler Integration
- Task parsing services
- XML validation
- Schema conformance
- Error surfacing
- Validation feedback
  
### Evaluator Support
- Error surfacing
- Reparse template support
- No retry management
- State preservation
- Recovery guidance
  
### LLM Session Management
- Handler encapsulation
- Resource tracking
- Model selection support
- Clean termination
- Session isolation
