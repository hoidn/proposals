## Purpose
Provides read-only context for task execution, including data context, chat history, system prompts, and templates. See [ADR:Memory:1.0] for architectural decisions and rationale.

## Working Memory Components
- Read-only data context (from associative matching or inheritance)
- Chat component (LLM-handler interaction history)
- System prompts
- Populated prompt templates

## Memory System Responsibilities

### Storage
The memory system provides storage but does not manage content:
- Data context: Stores but doesn't determine inheritance rules
- Templates/Prompts: Stores but doesn't handle population/validation
- Files: Maintains content but doesn't manage operations
- Long-term memory: Provides persistence layer for associative matching

### Context Management
Data context for a task can come from:
- Parent task inheritance
- Predecessor task (for map/sequence operations)
- Associative matching against long-term memory
Control of context source is via task library entries, not the memory system.

### Associative Matching
Implements context generation through:
- Matching against long-term memory content
- Incorporating prior task notes for relevance
- Supporting task-specific matching criteria
- Providing result filtration and ranking

### Notes Processing
- Stores unstructured task notes
- Makes notes available for subsequent matching
- Supports passing notes to child/successor tasks
- No enforced structure on note content

## Component Integration
- Context window management delegated to Handler
- Chat history managed by Handler
- Template management handled by Task System
- See [Contract:Integration:TaskMemory:1.0] for interface details

## Resource Management
Delegates to Handler (see [Interface:Handler:ResourceMonitoring:1.0]):
- Context window size tracking
- Resource usage monitoring
- Limit enforcement
- Cleanup coordination
