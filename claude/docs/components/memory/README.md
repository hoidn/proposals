## Purpose
Maintains global file metadata index to support associative matching in tasks. See [ADR:Memory:1.0] for architectural decisions and rationale.

## Memory System Responsibilities

### Storage
The memory system:
- Maintains global index of file paths and metadata
- Does not store or manage file content
- Provides base data for associative matching
- Does not handle task-specific context generation

### Associative Matching
Supports associative matching by:
- Providing GlobalIndex of file paths and metadata
- Enabling file discovery through metadata search
- Supporting task-specific matching via metadata
- Not handling actual context generation

Note: Actual context generation and inheritance is handled at the task execution level.

## Component Integration
- Context window management delegated to Handler
- Chat history managed by Handler
- Template management handled by Task System
- See [Contract:Integration:TaskMemory:1.0] for interface details

## Resource Management
Delegates to Handler (see [Interface:Handler:ResourceMonitoring:1.0]):
- Context window size tracking
- Resource usage monitoring
- Limit enforcement
- Cleanup coordination
