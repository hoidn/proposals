## Purpose
Manages working memory and context for task execution, including data context, chat history, system prompts, and templates. See [ADR:Memory:1.0] for architectural decisions and rationale.

## Working Memory Components
- Data context (from associative matching or inheritance)
- Chat component (LLM-handler interaction history)
- System prompts
- Populated prompt templates

## Memory System Responsibilities

### Storage
- Data context persistence 
- Template and prompt storage
- File content management
- Long-term memory maintenance

### Associative Matching
- Context generation from long-term memory
- Relevance-based matching
- Result filtration
- Prior task note incorporation

## Component Integration
- Context window management delegated to Handler
- Chat history managed by Handler
- Template management handled by Task System
- See [Contract:Integration:TaskMemory:1.0] for interface details

## Resource Management
Delegates to Handler (see [Interface:Handler:ResourceMonitoring:1.0]):
- Context window size tracking
- Resource usage monitoring
- Limit enforcement
- Cleanup coordination
