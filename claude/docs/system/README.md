# Intelligent Task Execution System

## Problem Statement
Software development and technical tasks require breaking down complex requirements into executable units. This typically requires human expertise for:
- Decomposing large tasks into smaller, manageable pieces  
- Recovering from failures by trying alternative approaches
- Maintaining relevant context across related subtasks
- Combining partial results into complete solutions

This system automates this process through intelligent task decomposition and execution while handling failures gracefully and maintaining task coherence.

## Overview

### Core Purpose and Goals
The system automates the process of breaking down complex software development and technical tasks into executable units by:
- Decomposing large tasks into manageable pieces
- Recovering from failures through alternative approaches
- Maintaining relevant context across subtasks
- Combining partial results into complete solutions

### High-Level Architecture
The system consists of four core components working together to process, execute, and manage tasks:

1. **Compiler**
   - Translates natural language to XML/AST
   - Handles task structure transformation and template validation

2. **Evaluator**
   - Provides unified task execution – processing AST nodes, managing recovery, and tracking resources
   - Uses standard task return statuses (`COMPLETE`, `CONTINUATION`, `FAILED`) without any specialized director/evaluator separation

3. **Task System**
   - Coordinates task execution via Handlers
   - Manages task templates, matching, and XML processing
   - Delegates context handling to the unified Evaluator

4. **Memory System**
   - Maintains task-related context (via a global file metadata index)
   - Supports associative matching for context generation

### Key Constraints

#### Resource Constraints
- Fixed context window size
- Limited turn counts
- Synchronous operation only
- File access via Handler tools only

#### Operational Constraints  
- One Handler per task execution
- Immutable Handler configuration
- No persistent state maintenance
- Template immutability during execution

## Components
