# Intelligent Task Execution System

## Problem Statement
Software development and technical tasks require breaking down complex requirements into executable units. This typically requires human expertise for:
- Decomposing large tasks into smaller, manageable pieces  
- Recovering from failures by trying alternative approaches
- Maintaining relevant context across related subtasks
- Combining partial results into complete solutions

This system automates this process through intelligent task decomposition and execution while handling failures gracefully and maintaining task coherence.

## Overview

### Core Purpose and Goals
The system automates the process of breaking down complex software development and technical tasks into executable units by:
- Decomposing large tasks into manageable pieces
- Recovering from failures through alternative approaches
- Maintaining relevant context across subtasks
- Combining partial results into complete solutions

### High-Level Architecture
The system consists of four core components working together to process, execute, and manage tasks:

1. Compiler
   - Translates natural language to XML/AST
   - Handles task structure transformation
   - Manages template validation

2. Evaluator
   - Controls AST processing and execution
   - Manages failure recovery
   - Tracks resource usage

3. Task System
   - Coordinates task execution via Handlers
   - Manages task templates and matching
   - Interfaces with Memory System

4. Memory System
   - Maintains working context
   - Handles context persistence
   - Manages file operations

### Key Constraints

#### Resource Constraints
- Fixed context window size
- Limited turn counts
- Synchronous operation only
- Read-only memory access

#### Operational Constraints  
- One Handler per task execution
- Immutable Handler configuration
- No persistent state maintenance
- Template immutability during execution

## Components

### Component Relationships
1. Compiler ↔ Task System
   - Task parsing coordination
   - Schema validation
   - Template utilization

2. Evaluator ↔ Compiler
   - AST execution feedback
   - Reparse requests

3. Task System ↔ Evaluator
   - Execution coordination
   - Resource allocation
   - State management
