# Resource Management Contracts [Contract:Resources:1.0]

## 1. Resource Types

### 1.1 Turn Counter
**Implementation**: [Component:Handler:1.0]  
**Interface**: [Interface:Handler:ResourceMonitoring:1.0]

The turn counter implements:
- Atomic per-session counter incremented with each LLM interaction
- Non-shared counter state isolated to individual Handler instances
- Hard limits enforced at the Handler level (defaults to system-wide value)
- Warning threshold at 80% of maximum turn count
- Clear metrics reporting through the ResourceMetrics interface
- Automatic cleanup on session termination

### 1.2 Context Window
**Implementation**: [Component:Handler:1.0]  
**Interface**: [Interface:Handler:ContextManagement:1.0]

The context window implementation provides:
- Token-based size calculation for all content
- Fraction-based limits (percentage of model's full context)
- Peak usage tracking for performance optimization
- Warning thresholds at 80% utilization
- No automatic content optimization (delegated to task implementation)
- Clean termination when limits are reached

### 1.3 Memory Resources
**Implementation**: [Component:Memory:3.0]

Memory resources are managed with:
- Isolated memory contexts per session
- Explicit garbage collection triggers
- Size-based eviction policies for context management
- Relevance-based retention for associative memory
- Explicit versioning for all stored artifacts

## 2. Resource Management Protocols

Resource management follows these concrete protocols:

1. **Allocation**: Resources are allocated at Handler initialization with explicit limits
2. **Tracking**: Usage is tracked with each operation and reported via ResourceMetrics
3. **Warning**: Non-fatal warnings are issued at 80% of resource limits
4. **Termination**: Clean termination occurs at hard limits with detailed error information
5. **Release**: Resources are explicitly released when sessions end

## 3. Contract Validation

Implementation must satisfy these technical requirements:

1. **Isolation**: No resource sharing between Handler instances
2. **Atomicity**: Resource operations must be atomic to prevent race conditions
3. **Reporting**: All resource usage must be reported through standard interfaces
4. **Recovery**: Resource exhaustion must trigger clean termination with recovery options
5. **Efficiency**: Resource tracking overhead must be <1% of total operation time
