# Resource Management Contracts [Contract:Resources:1.0]

## 1. Resource Types

### 1.1 Turn Counter
Implemented in [Component:Handler:1.0]. Tracking is defined in [Interface:Handler:ResourceMonitoring:1.0] and limits are enforced via [Pattern:Error:1.0]. For additional details, please refer to Appendix A.

### 1.2 Context Window
See [Interface:Handler:ContextManagement:1.0]. Detailed constraints and usage guidelines are provided in Appendix A.

### 1.3 Memory Resources
See [Component:MemorySystem:1.0]. Further specifications are outlined in Appendix A.

## 2. Resource Management Protocols

For tracking, allocation, and release requirements, please refer to Appendix A.

### 3. Contract Validation
Resource, operational, and implementation constraints are governed by the guidelines set forth in Appendix A.

## Appendix A: Contract Validation Guidelines

The following guidelines apply across all resource management and integration contracts:

1. **Required Fields:** All mandatory fields (e.g. turn limits, context window sizes) must be present and conform to type specifications.
2. **Uniqueness:** Input names and resource identifiers must be unique within their respective scopes.
3. **Format Validation:** Boolean fields must be exactly "true" or "false", and string fields must adhere to defined LLM identifier formats.
4. **Resource Limits:** Warning thresholds should be triggered at 80% usage, with hard limits enforced at 100%.
5. **Context Management:** Context data must be extended (not merged) to ensure immutability; new information is added via extension.

For further details and future updates, consult the development roadmap.
