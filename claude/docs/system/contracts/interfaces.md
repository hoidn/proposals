# System Interface Contracts

## 1. Component Integration Contracts

### 1.1 Compiler Integration [Contract:Integration:CompilerTask:1.0]
Defined in [Component:Compiler:1.0]
[TBD: Complete contract specification]

### 1.2 Evaluator Integration [Contract:Integration:EvaluatorTask:1.0]
See [Component:Evaluator:1.0] for complete interface.
[TBD: Complete contract specification]

### 1.3 Task System Integration
See [Component:TaskSystem:1.0] in components/task-system/README.md

#### Interfaces
- Task Execution: [Interface:TaskSystem:1.0] 
- Template Management: [Interface:TaskSystem:Templates:1.0]
- XML Processing: [Contract:Tasks:TemplateSchema:1.0]

#### Resource Contracts
See [Contract:Resources:1.0]

### 1.4 Memory System Integration [Contract:Integration:TaskMemory:3.0]
See [Component:MemorySystem:3.0]

#### Interfaces
- Context Management: [Interface:Memory:3.0]
  - Task System uses context management for task data
  - Associative matching uses context for results
- Index Management: [Interface:Memory:2.0]
  - Associative matching uses global index for file discovery
  - File metadata updates handled through bulk operations

#### Responsibilities
Memory System:
- Maintains short-term task context
- Maintains global file metadata index
- Provides bulk index updates

Task System:
- Uses context for task execution
- Receives file references from associative matching
- Delegates file access to Handler tools

#### Integration Points
- Context flow from associative matching to task execution
- File metadata index used for associative matching
- File access handled by Handler tools, not Memory System

## 2. Cross-Component Requirements

### 2.1 State Management
See [Pattern:Error:1.0] for error state handling.

Context Management:
- Task context maintained by Memory System
- Context operations provide immediate consistency
- No persistence guarantees for context data
- Context scope limited to current task execution

### 2.2 Error Propagation
Error handling defined in [Pattern:Error:1.0]

### 2.3 Resource Tracking
Resource contracts defined in [Contract:Resources:1.0]

Memory-Specific Resource Considerations:
- Context size limits defined by Handler
- Global index accessed in full only
- No partial index updates or queries
- File content handling delegated to Handler tools

## 3. Contract Validation 

### 3.1 Validation Requirements
- Context Management
  - Context updates must be atomic
  - Context retrieval must be consistent
  - No data persistence required
- Index Management
  - Index updates must be atomic
  - Index must persist across sessions
  - All file paths must be absolute
  - All metadata must be strings

### 3.2 Success Criteria
Context Management:
- Context updates visible to immediate subsequent reads
- No context data persists between sessions
- Context size within Handler limits

Index Management:
- Index survives system restarts
- Bulk updates atomic and consistent
- All paths resolvable by Handler tools

### 3.3 Verification Methods
- Unit tests for context operations
- Integration tests for index persistence
- Validation of file paths with Handler tools
- Context size limit compliance checks
