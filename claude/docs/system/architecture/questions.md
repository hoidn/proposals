# Open Architecture Questions

## Critical (Required for MVP)

### Resource Management
1. How should warning thresholds affect task execution?
   - Should tasks be notified of warnings?
   - Should execution continue normally until hard limits?
   - What metrics need to be preserved?

2. What is the exact protocol for minimal context selection?
   - How is "minimal required context" determined?
   - What happens if context selection fails?
   - Who makes the selection decision?

3. What cleanup guarantees are needed between tasks?
   - What must be cleaned up vs what can persist?
   - How are resources released?
   - What happens to in-progress operations?

### Error Handling
1. How should resource exhaustion errors be handled?
   - What context needs to be preserved?
   - Should partial results be kept?
   - What recovery options should be available?

2. What error conditions require task termination vs continuation?
   - Which errors are recoverable?
   - When should tasks be restarted vs continued?
   - How are errors propagated?

## Important (Needed Soon After MVP)

### Memory System
1. How should memory system operations be metered?
   - Do we need limits on memory operations?
   - How are memory operation failures handled?
   - What metrics should be tracked?

2. What is the associative memory matching protocol?
   - How are matches scored?
   - What happens with low-quality matches?
   - How is relevance determined?

### Task Execution
1. How should task transitions be managed?
   - What state needs to be preserved?
   - How are resources transferred?
   - What cleanup is required?

2. When should tasks be allowed to merge contexts?
   - What are the rules for context combination?
   - How are conflicts handled?
   - What validation is needed?

## Future Considerations

### Optimization
1. Are there cases where resource sharing could be beneficial?
2. Should we allow resource reservation for known upcoming needs?
3. How do we handle peak load conditions?

### Context Management
1. Should we track context usage patterns?
2. Do we need context versioning?
3. Should we cache frequent contexts?

### Monitoring
1. What metrics need to be exposed for system health?
2. How should resource usage be tracked over time?
3. What alerting is needed?

## Notes
- Questions are ordered by dependency (what blocks what) and impact on MVP functionality
- Focus areas derived from current documentation gaps
- Some questions may be answerable through implementation experience rather than up-front design
- Security considerations may raise additional questions that need to be prioritized
