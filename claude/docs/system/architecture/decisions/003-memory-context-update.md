# Architecture Decision Record: Remove Context Update Capability

## Status
Accepted

## Context
The Memory System's updateContext capability was found to be inconsistent with its architectural goals:
- System primarily provides context FOR tasks
- No persistence guarantees documented
- Context scope limited to current task
- No clear use cases for bi-directional context flow

## Decision
Remove updateContext method and enforce read-only context model.

### Changes
1. Remove updateContext from [Interface:Memory:3.0]
2. Enforce read-only context access
3. Maintain clear task isolation
4. Simplify state management

### Version Impact
- Major version increment to 3.0
- Breaking change for interface consumers
- Required updates to dependent systems

## Consequences

### Positive
- Clearer architectural boundaries
- Simpler interface
- Better task isolation
- Reduced state complexity
- More predictable behavior

### Negative
- Breaking change for existing code
- Migration effort required
- Potential feature impact

## Implementation
1. Update interface definitions
2. Remove update capabilities
3. Update documentation
4. Add migration guide
5. Update cross-references
6. Release version 3.0
