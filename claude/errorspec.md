# Error Type Hierarchy and Handling Design

## Purpose
Define the core error taxonomy and handling strategy for the intelligent task execution system. Errors serve as a control flow mechanism to enable dynamic task adaptation and recovery.

## Error Categories

### 1. Resource Exhaustion
- **Purpose**: Signal when system resource limits are exceeded
- **Characteristics**:
  - Parameterized resource type and limits
  - Clear thresholds for triggering
  - No partial results/state needed
- **Recovery Strategy**: 
  - Trigger task decomposition into smaller units
  - Resource limits inform decomposition strategy

### 2. Invalid Output Structure
- **Purpose**: Signal task output validation failures
- **Characteristics**:
  - Independent of operator type
  - Focused on structural correctness
  - No semantic validation required
- **Recovery Strategy**:
  - Trigger alternative task formulation
  - Requires different prompting strategy

### 3. Failure to Make Progress
- **Purpose**: Signal when task execution stalls
- **Characteristics**:
  - Based on task-specific progress indicators
  - Identified through task output
  - No internal progress tracking
- **Recovery Strategy**:
  - Trigger alternative task approach
  - May require different context selection

### 4. XML Validation Errors
- **Purpose**: Signal XML structural or template validation failures
- **Characteristics**:
  - Immediate failure on invalid structure
  - No warning collection
  - Clear error messages
- **Recovery Strategy**:
  - Evaluator handles recovery
  - No internal retry attempts

## Error Handling Principles

### 1. Separation of Concerns
- Errors focus purely on signaling failure conditions
- Progress tracking belongs to task system
- Retry counting belongs to evaluator
- Context management handled by memory system

### 2. Control Flow
- Each error type maps to specific recovery path:
  - Resource Exhaustion → Task Decomposition
  - Invalid Output → Alternative Formulation
  - No Progress → Alternative Approach
  - XML Validation → Evaluator Recovery
- Recovery limit enforced by evaluator

### 3. Context Independence  
- Errors do not carry execution state
- No retry history in error objects
- No partial results in errors
- Task outputs handled by task system

## Integration Points

### Task System
- Raises appropriate error types
- Includes outputs in standard format
- Handles task-specific validation

### Evaluator
- Tracks retry attempts
- Maps errors to recovery strategies
- Manages execution flow

### Memory System
- Maintains execution context
- Handles context retrieval/updates
- Supports context selection during recovery

## Design Decisions & Rationale

1. Limited Error Categories
   - Rationale: Maps to core failure modes
   - Benefit: Direct mapping to recovery paths
   - Impact: Predictable error handling

2. Stateless Error Design
   - Rationale: Separates failure signaling from recovery
   - Benefit: Clean separation of concerns
   - Impact: Simplified error handling

3. Fixed Recovery Paths
   - Rationale: Each error type has clear recovery strategy
   - Benefit: Predictable system behavior
   - Impact: Streamlined implementation

## Dependencies
- Task system must implement standard output format
- Evaluator must track retries
- Memory system must support context updates

## Open Questions & Risks

1. Recovery Strategy Boundaries
   - Clear separation between strategies
   - Strategy selection criteria
   - Strategy effectiveness measurement

2. Context Selection
   - Context relevance during recovery
   - Context update boundaries
   - Context consistency requirements

## Future Considerations

1. Error Response Refinement
   - Strategy effectiveness tracking
   - Context selection optimization
   - Recovery path optimization

2. System Monitoring
   - Error pattern analysis
   - Resource utilization tracking
   - Recovery success rates
