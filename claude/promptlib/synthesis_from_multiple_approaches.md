review the three <approaches> and evaluate them, comparing them to each other and to the existing .md architecture docs. Evaluate:

- the comprehensiveness of each approach in improving the system architecture
- how well it integrates with the existing arch docs
- any other relevant criteria

Then, generate a synthesis of the three plans. Justify your choices. Your final output should be a detailed synthesis plan. Include code samples (if appropriate), but omit impl details. Declare any data structures or interfaces that need to be altered from the existing documentation, or that have not yet been specified.

# Task System Architecture and Implementation Plan

## 1. Objectives and Integration with Existing Architecture

### Comprehensiveness
The plan covers task organization (by type and subtype), task lookup and registration, first-class function calling with parameter and return-value support, and a new conditional primitive that enforces JSON output formatting. This is in line with the goals of Approaches 1, 2, and 3.

### Integration
- **XML Task Definitions & AST**: The proposed changes work with the current XML schema (see operators.md and protocols.md) by adding an optional reference attribute to tasks.
- **Environment & Evaluator**: The Evaluator (documented in misc/textonly.tex.md and system/architecture/overview.md) is modified to include a reference to the new TaskLibrary.
- **Error Handling & Resource Management**: The new function-calling mechanism is designed to work with existing error categories (see errorspec.md) and does not alter the fundamental resource tracking managed by the Handler.

### Other Criteria
- The plan is backward compatible for MVP (by initially supporting inline tasks) and then evolves to use a full registry.
- It separates concerns cleanly by moving task definitions out of the Evaluator's runtime environment into a dedicated library.

## 2. Proposed Architecture Modifications

### A. Introduce a Separate TaskLibrary Component

#### Purpose
Maintain an in-memory registry of task definitions (both atomic and composite) organized hierarchically by type and subtype. This decouples task metadata from the runtime environment.

#### Data Structure & Interface
```python
# New data structure for task definitions
class TaskDefinition:
    def __init__(self, name, type, subtype, metadata, ast_node):
        self.name = name          # Unique identifier
        self.type = type          # e.g., "atomic", "composite"
        self.subtype = subtype    # e.g., "director", "evaluator", etc.
        self.metadata = metadata  # Extra properties (e.g., parameter schema)
        self.ast_node = ast_node  # Parsed representation (e.g., XML -> AST)

# TaskLibrary maintains a registry of tasks organized by type and subtype
class TaskLibrary:
    def __init__(self):
        self.tasks = {
            'atomic': {},
            'composite': {},
            # ... add other task categories as needed
        }
    
    def register_task(self, task_def: TaskDefinition):
        """Registers a task in the appropriate category."""
        if task_def.name in self.tasks.get(task_def.type, {}):
            raise ValueError(f"Task {task_def.name} is already registered.")
        self.tasks[task_def.type].setdefault(task_def.subtype, {})[task_def.name] = task_def

    def get_task(self, name: str) -> TaskDefinition:
        """Lookup task by name across all types."""
        for type_group in self.tasks.values():
            for subtype_group in type_group.values():
                if name in subtype_group:
                    return subtype_group[name]
        raise KeyError(f"Task {name} not found.")
```

#### Integration
```typescript
// Extended Environment interface (TypeScript-like pseudocode)
interface Environment {
    variables: Map<string, any>;
    parent?: Environment;
    taskLibrary: TaskLibrary;  // New: reference to shared task registry
}
```

### B. Unify Function Calling via a FunctionCall AST Node

#### Purpose
Treat tasks as first-class functions that can be called with arguments and return results. Both atomic and composite tasks are uniformly callable.

#### AST Node for Function Calls
```python
class FunctionCall(ASTNode):
    def __init__(self, func_name, args):
        self.func_name = func_name  # Name of the task/function to call
        self.args = args            # List of ASTNodes representing arguments

    def eval(self, env: Environment):
        # Lookup the task definition from the TaskLibrary
        task_def = env.taskLibrary.get_task(self.func_name)
        
        # Create a new environment for the function call
        func_env = env.extend()  # Assuming extend() clones environment bindings
        
        # Bind parameters (assuming task_def.metadata.parameters exists)
        for param, arg_node in zip(task_def.metadata.get("parameters", []), self.args):
            func_env.variables[param] = arg_node.eval(env)
        
        # Evaluate the task's AST (could be atomic or composite)
        result = task_def.ast_node.eval(func_env)
        
        # Process return values according to task_def.metadata.returns (if specified)
        # (Return binding logic omitted for brevity)
        
        return result
```

#### Notes
- This node is added to the AST type system (see components/task-system/spec/types.md)
- It allows tasks to be composed (as in the director-evaluator pattern) and reused

### C. Support for Task Loading and Reference Resolution

#### MVP vs. Future Phases

**Phase 1 (MVP):**
- Tasks are inlined in the AST when loaded from XML files
- The Evaluator directly executes these inline definitions without needing reference resolution

**Phase 2 (Transitional Hybrid):**
- Introduce a ref attribute in the XML schema so that a task node may reference a pre-registered task in the TaskLibrary
- The Evaluator, when encountering a `<task ref="taskName">` node, looks up the task definition

**Phase 3 (Mature Implementation):**
- Tasks (and composite procedures) become first-class functions that can be defined, passed as arguments, and stored

#### XML Schema Update Example
```diff
<xs:element name="task">
  <xs:complexType>
    <xs:attribute name="type" use="required">
      <xs:simpleType>
        <xs:restriction base="xs:string">
          <xs:enumeration value="atomic"/>
          <xs:enumeration value="sequential"/>
          <xs:enumeration value="reduce"/>
+         <xs:enumeration value="script"/>
        </xs:restriction>
      </xs:simpleType>
    </xs:attribute>
+   <xs:attribute name="ref" type="xs:string" use="optional"/>
+   <xs:attribute name="subtype" type="xs:string" use="optional"/>
  </xs:complexType>
</xs:element>
```

### D. Add a Conditional Primitive (cond) with JSON Output Enforcement

#### Purpose
To allow tasks to conditionally execute based on their outputs, task results must be structured (e.g., in JSON). This primitive acts as a bridge between the DSL and Python types.

#### Evaluator Function Sample
```python
import json

def eval_cond(condition_expr, env):
    """
    Evaluate a condition against the last task output.
    Expects env.last_output to be a JSON-formatted string.
    """
    try:
        output = json.loads(env.last_output)
    except json.JSONDecodeError:
        raise Exception("TASK_FAILURE: Task output must be valid JSON for conditionals.")
    
    # Evaluate the condition (details omitted)
    # For example, using a simple Python eval with a safe environment
    if eval(condition_expr, {"output": output}):
        return True
    else:
        return False
```

#### DSL XML Example for cond
```xml
<cond>
    <case test="output.valid == true">
        <task type="atomic" subtype="success_handler">
            <description>Handle success</description>
        </task>
    </case>
    <case test="output.errors > 0">
        <task type="atomic" subtype="error_handler">
            <description>Handle error</description>
        </task>
    </case>
</cond>
```

### E. Data Structures and Interfaces to Alter or Declare

#### Environment Interface
- Add a taskLibrary field as shown above

#### AST Types
- Introduce a new FunctionCall node (see above)
- Extend existing AST node types to optionally include a "ref" field for tasks

#### XML Schema
- Extend the `<task>` element to include optional attributes ref and subtype (see diff above)

#### TaskDefinition
- A new data structure (as shown above) that holds task metadata (including parameter and return specifications)

#### TaskLibrary
- A new component that maps task names to TaskDefinition instances (see sample above)

#### Output Formatting
- Enforce that tasks which are candidates for conditional execution must output JSON
- May require updating task templates in the documentation to include an `<expected_output>` specification

## 3. Transition Roadmap

### Phase 1: Minimal Implementation (MVP)
- Inline Tasks: Continue to support inlined XML task definitions in the AST
- Basic Function Calling: Implement the FunctionCall node
- Conditional Primitive: Add support for the cond primitive
- No Reference Resolution: Use inline definitions

### Phase 2: Hybrid Model
- Task Registration: Introduce the TaskLibrary component
- XML References: Update XML schema for task references
- Evaluator Changes: Implement task definition lookup

### Phase 3: Mature First-Class Functions
- Function Abstraction: Support parameterized, first-class task functions
- Extended DSL: Add function definitions and calls syntax
- Refactor Evaluator: Integrate new function-calling mechanism

## 4. Integration with Existing Components

### Evaluator
- Modified to use FunctionCall nodes and consult TaskLibrary

### Compiler
- Updated to parse new XML attributes and generate corresponding AST nodes

### Error Handling
- Task outputs validated for JSON formatting with cond
- Invalid formats trigger standard TASK_FAILURE errors

### Memory & Resource Management
- New components don't interfere with resource tracking
- Handler continues to manage all resource and turn-count management

### Documentation
- Update relevant sections to reflect new mechanisms

## 5. Summary and Justification
