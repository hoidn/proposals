Files_Requiring_Updates:
  - path: ./components/task-system/spec/types.md
    reason: Need to add new TaskLibrary and function calling types

      - Add FunctionCall node type for AST
      - Update TaskType enum to include script type
      - Add ContextManagement type updates for inheritance modes
    dependencies:
      - Evaluator component
      - XML schema definitions
      - AST processing
  
  - path: ./components/task-system/spec/interfaces.md
    reason: Need to add TaskLibrary and function interfaces
    spec_of_changes:
      - Add TaskLibrary interface methods
      - Add function calling methods to TaskSystem
      - Update Handler interface for script execution
      - Add environment chaining support
    dependencies:
      - TaskSystem component
      - Evaluator component
      - Handler component

  - path: ./components/evaluator/README.md
    reason: Update for new environment model and function calling
    spec_of_changes:
      - Add nested environment model details
      - Document function calling behavior
      - Update context inheritance description
      - Add script execution handling
    dependencies:
      - Task System types
      - XML schema

  - path: ./system/contracts/protocols.md
    reason: XML schema updates needed for new features
    spec_of_changes:
      - Add function definition schema
      - Add script task schema
      - Update context management schema
      - Add ref and subtype attributes
    dependencies:
      - Task System types
      - Template validation

  - path: ./system/architecture/patterns/resource-management.md
    reason: Update for script execution and sequential history
    spec_of_changes:
      - Add script resource management details
      - Update sequential history tracking
      - Document environment extension pattern
    dependencies:
      - Handler component
      - Memory System

  - path: ./components/memory/api/interfaces.md
    reason: Update for new environment model 
    spec_of_changes:
      - Remove updateContext method
      - Add structured input format for getRelevantContextFor
      - Update GlobalIndex interface
    dependencies:
      - Memory System component
      - Task System integration

Architectural_Impact_Assessment:
  backwards_compatibility:
    - XML schema changes are backwards compatible via optional attributes
    - Error handling remains unchanged
    - Memory interface changes are breaking but planned
  
  new_dependencies: 
    - Task Library requires persistent storage
    - Function calling requires environment chaining
    - Script execution requires Handler integration
  
  complexity_changes:
    - More complex environment model with chaining
    - Additional task types to manage
    - New validation requirements for task definitions
    - Script execution adds external process management
  
  performance_considerations:
    - Environment chaining depth should be monitored
    - Script execution timing needs limits
    - Task Library lookup performance important
    - Sequential history size needs limits

Questions_For_Clarification:
  - What is the persistence model for the TaskLibrary - in-memory only or disk backed?
  - Should script execution have separate resource limits from LLM tasks?
  - How should environment chain depth be limited to prevent stack overflow?
  - What validation should be done on script task inputs/outputs?
  - Should TaskLibrary support versioning of task definitions?
  - What's the cleanup protocol for sequential history in error cases?
  - How should script execution timeouts be handled?
  - Should there be a limit on the number of registered tasks?
